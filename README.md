# Hydro-Insights: Environmental Sustainability Platform

Welcome to Hydro-Insights, an open-source platform aimed at promoting environmental sustainability through computational mathematics. This project is developed by Team EcoEquations as part of the Ecothon hackathon.

## Project Overview

Hydro-Insights is a platform designed to centralize data collection for studying pollution in water bodies. It provides a map interface displaying industries, water bodies, and labs, enabling users to identify optimal sites for data collection to pinpoint sources of pollution. The platform facilitates data collection by individuals, including students supervised by authorized professors, and suggests missing data points.
